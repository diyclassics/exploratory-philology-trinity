    "- If you press \"SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN\", you will *run* that cell and the output will appear in space below the cell; you will also advance to the next cell. If you press \"CTRL + ENTER/RETURN\", you will run the cell without advancing. If you press \"OPTION (or ALT) + ENTER/RETURN\", you will run the cell and insert a new empty cell below the running cell.\n",
